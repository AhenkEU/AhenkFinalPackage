## Introduction
  This package contains 3 functions, written by Ahenk and curated into a package.
  They are as following.


1. isAllUnique
1. isPermPalindrome
1. missingNOs

## Functions
### 1. isAllUnique
  It takes a string as an argument and checks whether all the characters are unique(there are no duplicates of any letter)  
  If all the characters are unique, it prints out "All unique"
  If it finds and duplicate characters it prints out "Duplicates found."  
  Doesn't return anything. It only prints out to the console.  
  It is CaSe SeNSiTiVe. That means a and A won't be processed as same letters.   

### Ex.  

    ExampleString<-"AaBCD"
    isAllUnique(ExampleString)

    "All unique"
</div>
  ------------------------------------

    ExampleString2<-"ABA"
    isAllUnique(ExampleString2)

    "Duplicates Found."  
 
### 2. isPermPalindrome
  It takes a string as an argument and returns true if the string is a permutation of a palindrome.  
  If its not a permutation of a palindrome, it returns false.  
  It is CaSe SeNSiTiVe. That means a and A won't be processed as same letters.  
  
### Ex.    
  * **isPermPalindrome("kayak")** returns true  
  * **isPermPalindrome("yakak")** returns true  
  * **isPermPalindrome("yaKak")** returns false  
 
### 3. missingNOs
  It takes a list as an argument containing integers from 1 to 100.  
  You can exclude any amount of numbers from the list.  
  It checks and prints the missing numbers on the console.  
  It can only work with integers from 1-100 and DOESN'T WORK with letters or symbols.  
  
### Ex  
  Setting up a dummy list.  
  
    p1<-c(1:45)
    p2<-c(47:82)
    p3<-c(90:98)
    GivenList<-c(p1,p2,p3)

  Sending the dummy list to the function.  
    **`missingNOs(GivenList)`**

  Output on console:  
  
  `[1] 46
[1] 83
[1] 84
[1] 85
[1] 86
[1] 87
[1] 88
[1] 89
[1] 99
[1] 100`
